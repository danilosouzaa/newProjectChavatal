Warning: excessive time spent in model updates.
Consider calling update less frequently.

Optimize a model with 1450 rows, 10797 columns and 137825 nonzeros
Coefficient statistics:
  Matrix range     [1e-05, 9e+01]
  Objective range  [0e+00, 0e+00]

Warning: Model contains large bounds
         Consider reformulating model or setting NumericFocus parameter
         to avoid numerical issues.
